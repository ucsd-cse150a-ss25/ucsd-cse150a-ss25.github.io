## Week 1 Discussion

**Note:** On the course website (link available on the Canvas home page) there is a link in week 1 to the Bayes rule notebook. You will fill out and **write code** to implement the missing cells in the notebook, and save it as a pdf. **Important for this week only: in Google Colab you can directly use your browser’s print command to export as a pdf. For mac, for example, this is `cmd+P`. In future classes, we will be using `nbconvert` to create pdfs.**

Note that for this week’s discussion **only**, we have extended the deadline to Wednesday 8:00AM to submit your notebooks.
